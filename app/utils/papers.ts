    title: "Attention Is All You Need",
    abstract:
      "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.",

    title: "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding",
    abstract:
      "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

    title: "Generative Adversarial Networks",
    abstract:
      "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G.",

    title: "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition",
    abstract:
      "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.",

    title: "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners",
    abstract:
      "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples.",

    title: "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale",
    abstract:
      "While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place.",

    title: "DALLÂ·E 2: Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation",
    abstract:
      "We present a hierarchical approach for text-conditional image generation that generates images using a two-stage process: first generating a low-resolution image based on the input text, then upsampling it to a high-resolution image. This approach allows for more coherent and detailed image generation compared to single-stage methods.",

    title: "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks",
    abstract:
      "Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. We propose the lottery ticket hypothesis: dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks that achieve comparable accuracy to the original network when trained in isolation.",

    title: "Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations",
    abstract:
      "Unsupervised visual representation learning has proven to be very effective in learning useful representations without human annotation. In this work, we propose a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations called SimCLR. Our framework learns representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data example via a contrastive loss in the latent space.",

    title: "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection",
    abstract:
      "We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.",
